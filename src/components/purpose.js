        Hi and welcome to my Pokemon application. Using the PokeAPI this site is able to allow you to sort and search through various pokemon of various generations. You can also add favorites from these lists and compare their stats! Hoping to add maps of spawn locations as well if I can find the resource. Hope you enjoy
